# VMware vCenter Server Integration

This Python script connects to a VMware vCenter Server, retrieves details for all virtual machines, and suggests the best host to run each virtual machine based on CPU, RAM, number of disks, and GPU availability. The script then writes the VM details to a CSV file, with each row containing the VM name and its corresponding host.

# Installation

To run this script, you'll need to install the following Python packages:
 * pyVmomi
 * pandas


You can install these packages using pip, the Python package manager:

```bash
pip install pyVmomi pandas
```
# Configuration

Before running the script, you'll need to edit the following variables in the code:

    <vcenter-hostname>: the hostname or IP address of your vCenter Server.
    <username>: your vCenter Server username.
    <password>: your vCenter Server password.
    <vcenter-port>: the port number to use for connecting to vCenter Server (default is 443).

Usage

To run the script, simply execute the vmware_integration.py file using Python:

```bash
python vmware_integration.py
```
The script will connect to vCenter Server, retrieve VM details, suggest the best host for each VM, and write the VM details to a CSV file named vm_details.csv. The CSV file will contain one row for each VM, with columns for the VM name, number of CPUs, amount of memory, number of disks, disk sizes, and GPU availability.
